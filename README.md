# Capstone-Project

HoliDate: A social media platform to connect people who are traveling - allowing people to post pictures of their different vacation destinations, connect with people in the same place with similar interests and following people with fun travel experiences.

We are aiming to create a full fledged web application that people can use to connect with other travelholics. This web application will allow people to show off their travel photos, connect with like minded travelers and gain travel inspiration from other peopleâ€™s feed.
